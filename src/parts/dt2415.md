## The Denver Timekeeping Story
</WideSubtitleBlock>

When Denver Timekeeping founders Chad and Becca set up their small-batch chip fab in the mountain town of Denver, Colorado, there were many who were dubious, to say the least. “You can’t manufacture in America anymore,” they said. “It’s too expensive, and hasn’t all that expertise left the country anyhow?”

But Chad and Becca persistently stuck to their vision of inexpensive, reliable, and American-made timekeeping chips manufactured the old way. And, after many trials and tribulations, they are proud to announce the Denver Timekeeping DT2415. Made in the cool air and with the pure water of the Rocky Mountains, this real-time clock includes a backup battery that ensures the time is kept even when power is not— a must-have for ruggedized devices. 

We hope you enjoy this chip. And if you’re ever in Denver, drop us a line. Chad and Becca love to show customers around the fab.
