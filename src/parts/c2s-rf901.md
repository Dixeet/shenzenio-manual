## Non-Blocking Buffer

All data received is passed through an internal non-blocking buffer. Reading from the `C2S-RF901` when no data is available will yield a value of `-999` instead of blocking until data arrives (which is typical XBus behavior). With the `C2S-RF901`, you can keep working while you wait for data to arrive!
