## General description
</WideSubtitleBlock>

`200P-14` read-only memory by Pingda Co. Ltd. offers embedded system engineers the ability to easily access up to fourteen factory-programmed memory cells for a wide range of diverse applications. With its convenient auto-increment feature, you wonâ€™t have to waste precious registers keeping track of memory addresses.

## Features
</WideSubtitleBlock>

- (14) random-access memory cells
- (2) independent, auto-incrementing memory pointers

## Usage
</WideSubtitleBlock>

- All memory cell values are set in advance by the design engineer.
- All memory pointers initialize to point at the first memory cell (`address 0`).
- Memory pointers can be read over XBus with the `a0` and `a1` address pins.
- Memory values referenced by pointers can be read over XBus with the `d0` and `d1` data pins.
- After reading from a data pin, the corresponding memory pointer will automatically increment to the next memory location.
