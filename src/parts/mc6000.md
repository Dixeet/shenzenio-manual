<WideSubtitleBlock>DESCRIPTION</WideSubtitleBlock>

Offering maximum power so you can achieve a minimum chip count, the MC6000 is the centerpiece of 诚尚Micro’s MCxxxx microcontroller family. With plenty of room for complex instructions in its expansive fourteen-line program memory, two general-purpose registers, and six pins for I/O, the MC6000 can be at the center of even your most demanding embedded applications! Contact us to request samples.

<div class="--flex --justify-center">

| Register |                                  Purpose                                  |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|

_NOTE: At any given time, a simple I/O pin is either in **input mode** or **output mode**. Writing a value to a pin register will put the corresponding pin into **output mode** with the specified output value.
Reading a value from a pin register will put the corresponding pin into **input mode**, clearing any previously set output value._
