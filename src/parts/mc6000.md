<div class="--flex --justify-center">

| Register |                                  Purpose                                  |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   acc    | General purpose accumulator; is the target of all arithmetic instructions |
|   dat    |    General purpose data register; used for additional on-chip storage     |

_NOTE: At any given time, a simple I/O pin is either in **input mode** or **output mode**. Writing a value to a pin register will put the corresponding pin into **output mode** with the specified output value.
Reading a value from a pin register will put the corresponding pin into **input mode**, clearing any previously set output value._
