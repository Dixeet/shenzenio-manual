## Description
</WideSubtitleBlock>

A reduced-functionality microcontroller to help lower BOM costs, the MC4000 is a flexible and versatile alternative to its larger cousin, the MC6000. Donâ€™t let its diminutive size fool you, however: The MC4000 can easily hold its own with its generous nine lines of program memory, one general-purpose register, and four I/O pins.

We are confident the MC4000 will find its way into your designs and into your heart! Contact us to request samples.

- (9) lines of program memory
- (1) general-purpose register
- (2) XBus pins
- (2) simple I/O pins

Refer to the _[MCxxxx Language Reference ](/mcxxxx-language.html)_ for information about programming the MC4000.

_NOTE: As a result of customer feedback, an XBus-only variant will be made available later this year with the MC4000X part number._

<div class="--flex --justify-center">

| Register |                                  Purpose                                  |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   acc    | General purpose accumulator; is the target of all arithmetic instructions |
|   dat    |    General purpose data register; used for additional on-chip storage     |

_NOTE: At any given time, a simple I/O pin is either in **input mode** or **output mode**. Writing a value to a pin register will put the corresponding pin into **output mode** with the specified output value.
Reading a value from a pin register will put the corresponding pin into **input mode**, clearing any previously set output value._
