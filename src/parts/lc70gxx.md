# LC70Gxx SIMPLE I/O LOGIC GATE FAMILY

----

## LC70G04 / LC70G08 / LC70G32 / LC70G86


_We could all use a little more logic in our lives..._

The `LC70Gxx` logic gate family from The Logic Company™ offers that bit of extra logic you’ve been wanting— and for not a lot of money. With the `LC70Gxx` family you can rest assured your logical operations will be performed quickly, accurately, and with a minimum of extra “fuss.”

Embedded systems engineers the world over trust The Logic Company™ with logical operations every day... _day in and day out!_

- `LC70G04` is a one-input, one-output `inverter`.
- `LC70G08` is a two-input, one-output `AND` gate.
- `LC70G32` is a two-input, one-output `OR` gate.
- `LC70G86` is a two-input, one-output `XOR` gate.

When measuring inputs, signals less than 50 are interpreted as “off”, while signals greater than or equal to 50 are interpreted as “on”.
