## General description
</WideSubtitleBlock>

`100P-14`random-access memory by Pingda Co. Ltd. offers embedded system engineers additional storage for today’s increasingly data-driven world with a whopping fourteen memory cells. With its convenient auto-increment feature, you won’t have to waste precious registers keeping track of memory addresses.

## Features
</WideSubtitleBlock>

- (14) random-access memory cells
- (2) independent, auto-incrementing memory pointers

## Usage
</WideSubtitleBlock>

- All memory cells initialize to a value of 0.
- All memory pointers initialize to point at the first memory cell (`address 0`).
- Memory pointers can be read and written over XBus with the `a0` and `a1` address pins.
- Memory values referenced by pointers can be read and written over XBus with the `d0` and `d1` data pins.
- After reading from or writing to a data pin, the corresponding memory pointer will automatically increment to the next memory location.

## Example Circuit: Data Packet Reverser
</WideSubtitleBlock>

The following example circuit reads in 3-value packets from `input` and writes them back out to `output` in reverse order, using a `100P-14` to temporarily store the values.
