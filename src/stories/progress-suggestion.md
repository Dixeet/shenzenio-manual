# Some progress… and a suggestion
---

From: Margie Fish \<mfish@fish.partners\>

Good morning!

Just a quick update for you today. First off, I’ve placed your resume with two
new agencies. They specialize in industries a little different from yours, but you
never know where a match might be made! I’ve also reached out to a few more
of my colleagues across the country, letting them know to get in touch if they
hear of anything. Finally, I followed up with Electromotiv again, but they keep
stalling. At this point I think it’s safe to say an offer won’t be coming.

You’ve been with us for a while now and I appreciate your trust, so I want to be
honest: The likelihood of us finding you something that genuinely makes use of
your skills in the foreseeable future is rather low. This isn’t because of any lack
of qualifications on your part... It is simply a reflection of the realities of the time.
We’ll keep trying, of course! I just wanted to ensure you kept some realistic
expectations in mind going forward.

I know you’ve said you were hoping to stay in the country, but it may be time to
reconsider that stance. Many of the people we represent have done stints overseas and report that it is an eye-opening, and in some cases, career-enhancing
move. I don’t have a lot of contacts in that particular arena, but I can point you
in the direction of someone I know who has some experience working with
Chinese electronics firms. Let me know if that sounds interesting to you and I’ll
get you two introduced.

M.
