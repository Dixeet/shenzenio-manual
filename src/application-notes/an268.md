# Application Note 268 <br>Two Interfaces, Limitless Possibilities

----

There are two types of pins on MCxxxx microcontrollers: simple I/O and XBus. Note that they are not
interoperable, and can only be connected to another pin of the same type. 

## Simple I/O

Simple I/O values are continuous signal levels from 0 to 100,
inclusive. Simple I/O pins are unmarked.

Simple I/O is used for applications such as connecting a microcontroller to a simple input, such as a button, switch, or microphone,
or a simple output, such as an LED, a speaker, or a motor.

## XBus

XBus values are discrete data packets from -999 to 999, inclusive. XBus pins are marked with a yellow dot.

XBus is commonly used to transmit data between two microcontrollers or a microcontroller and complex input or output, such as a keypad or numeric display.

## Simple I/O vs. XBus Behavior

Simple I/O pins can be read or written at any time with no regard to the state of connected devices.

XBus, however, is a synchronized protocol. Data over XBus pins is only transferred when there is
**both a reader attempting to read and a writer attempting to write**. If a read or write is attempted
without a corresponding operation on a connected device, the operation will block.
