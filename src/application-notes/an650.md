# Application Note 650<br>Reference Design: Touch-Activated Light Controller

----

<WideSubtitleBlock>EXAMPLE CIRCUIT</WideSubtitleBlock>

The following circuit is a reference design for a touch-activated light controller. When a user touches
a capacitive switch, the controller will detect the rising edge and advance the light to the next intensity
level, from off, to 50%, to 100%, and back to off.

The circuit consists of two MC4000 microcontrollers that communicate over XBus:

- The first microcontroller reads from the capacitive switch on simple I/O pin p0 and sends either a
0 or 1 over XBus to the second microcontroller every time unit, where a value of 0 means that the
switch wasnâ€™t touched and a value of 1 means that the switch was touched. By storing the previous
reading from the capacitive switch in acc, the first microcontroller can detect a transition from low
(0) to high (100).

- The second microcontroller stores the current state of the light in its acc register. It waits for an XBus
value from the first microcontroller using the slx instruction, and then increments acc by 50 if the
value is 1. When acc is incremented past 100, it resets acc back to 0. The resulting value is then
used to drive the light using simple I/O pin p1.
