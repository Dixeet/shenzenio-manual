# Application Note 393 <br>Make Sure To Get Enough Sleep!

- CPUs are typically much faster than the signals they are reading and writing.
- A CPU can execute a very large number of instructions within one time unit.
- To advance to the beginning of the next time unit, a CPU can go to sleep.
- To put a CPU to sleep, use the slp instruction and specify the number of time units to sleep.
