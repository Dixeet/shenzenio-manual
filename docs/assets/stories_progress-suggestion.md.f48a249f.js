First off, I’ve placed your resume with two new agencies. They specialize in industries a little different from yours, but you never know where a match might be made! I’ve also reached out to a few more of my colleagues across the country, letting them know to get in touch if they hear of anything. Finally, I followed up with Electromotiv again, but they keep stalling. At this point I think it’s safe to say an offer won’t be coming.</p><p>You’ve been with us for a while now and I appreciate your trust, so I want to be honest: The likelihood of us finding you something that genuinely makes use of your skills in the foreseeable future is rather low. This isn’t because of any lack of qualifications on your part... It is simply a reflection of the realities of the time. We’ll keep trying, of course! I just wanted to ensure you kept some realistic expectations in mind going forward.</p><p>I know you’ve said you were hoping to stay in the country, but it may be time to reconsider that stance. Many of the people we represent have done stints overseas and report that it is an eye-opening, and in some cases, career-enhancing move. I don’t have a lot of contacts in that particular arena, but I can point you in the direction of someone I know who has some experience working with Chinese electronics firms. Let me know if that sounds interesting to you and I’ll get you two introduced.</p><p>M.</p><p>-----</p><p>Margie Fish, President<br> Fish Partners Recruiting</p><p><em>“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step…”</em></p>',11),a=[n];function r(u,h,p,c,g,l){return t(),o("div",null,a)}const m=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
